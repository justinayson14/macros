Macros

Need from user:
- body weight
- activity level
- estimate body fat

Need to find: 
- basal metabolic rate
- cut/maintain/bulk calories
- protein/carbs/fat grams

Formulas:
- weight * activity level (12-16) = basal metabolic rate in calories
- maintenance calories = bmr
- maintenance - deficit (500) = cut calories
- maintenance + surplus (500) = bulk calories
- weight * protein = protein intake in g/lb
    - .75 g = new to training/overweight
    - 1 g = in shape/around 20% bf/golden area
    - 1.25 g = shredded/cardio with training
- weight * fat = fat intake in g/lb
    - .3 g = loves carbs
    - .35 g = balance area
    - .4 g = loves butter, nuts
- cut/bulk calories - ([protein intake * 4] + [fat intake * 9]) = carbs / 4 = carb intake in g/lb

Some notes:
- track weight per day and find average weight per week
- if weight lost is below 1 lb/week, reduce carbs by 15g/do more cardio,
- stay around 55 g - 65 g in fat
- if you diet for long time, take a diet break if you reach plateu and incease food
